## Questions

### What is the topic that you have finalized? (Answer in 1 or 2 sentences)
The topic that I have finalized is about the correlation between the popularity of Spotify songs and the elements of the music. 

### What are the data sources that you have curated so far? (Answer 1 or 2 sentences).
The data source I have obtained is for free, and originates from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/spotify-songs 

The data set contains information on the track popularity, danceability of the music, energy of the music and liveliness of the music.

```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Data set
library(tidyverse)
Spotify <- read.csv("spotify_songs.csv")

# First 5 rows of the data set
head(Spotify, 5)
```
